<h1>Don’t Believe You’ll Self-Deceive</h1>
<p  style='text-align: center;'> ❦
</p>
<p>I don’t mean to seem like I’m picking on Kurige, but I think you have to expect a certain amount of questioning if you show up on <em>Less Wrong</em> and <a class='urllink' href='https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#gk' rel='nofollow'>say</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing I’ve come to realize that helps to explain the disparity I feel when I talk with most other Christians is the fact that somewhere along the way my world-view took a major shift away from blind faith and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Orwellian double-think.
</p></blockquote>
<p>“If you <em>know</em> it’s <a class='wikilink' href='DoublethinkChoosingToBeBiased.html'>double-think</a>…
</p>
<p>… how can you still believe it?” I helplessly want to say.
</p>
<p><a class='urllink' href='https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/#u3' rel='nofollow'>Or</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose to believe in the existence of God—deliberately and consciously. This decision, however, has absolutely zero effect on the actual existence of God.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you <em>know</em> your belief isn’t correlated to reality, how can you still believe it?
</p>
<p>Shouldn’t the <em>gut-level</em> realization, “Oh, wait, the sky really <em>isn’t</em> green” follow from the realization “My map that says ‘the sky is green’ has no reason to be correlated with the territory”?
</p>
<p>Well… apparently not.
</p>
<p>One part of this puzzle may be my explanation of <a class='wikilink' href='Moores-Paradox.html'>Moore’s Paradox</a> (“It’s raining, but I don’t believe it is”)—that people introspectively mistake positive affect attached to a quoted belief, for actual credulity.
</p>
<p>But another part of it may just be that—contrary to the indignation I initially wanted to put forward—it’s actually quite <em>easy</em> not to make the jump from “The map that reflects the territory would say ‘<em>X</em>’ ” to actually believing “<em>X</em>.” It takes some work to <em>explain</em> the ideas of <a class='wikilink' href='WhatIsEvidence.html'>minds as map-territory correspondence builders</a>, and even then, it may take more work to get the implications on a <em>gut level</em>.
</p>
<p>I realize now that when I wrote “You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will,” I wasn’t just a dispassionate reporter of the existing facts. I was also trying to instill a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</p>
<p>It may be wise to go around deliberately repeating “I can’t get away with double-thinking! Deep down, I’ll know it’s not true! If I know my map has no reason to be correlated with the territory, that means I don’t believe it!”
</p>
<p>Because that way—if you’re ever tempted to try—the thoughts “But I know this isn’t really true!” and “I can’t fool myself!” will always rise readily to mind; and that way, you will indeed be less likely to fool yourself successfully. You’re more likely to get, on a gut level, that telling yourself <em>X</em> doesn’t make <em>X</em> true: and therefore, really truly not-<em>X</em>.
</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that you <em>can’t</em> just deliberately choose to believe the sky is green—then you’re less likely to succeed in fooling yourself on one level or another; either in the sense of really believing it, or of falling into Moore’s Paradox, <a class='wikilink' href='BeliefInBelief.html'>belief in belief</a>, or <a class='wikilink' href='BeliefInSelfDeception.html'>belief in self-deception</a>.
</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that deep down you’ll know—
</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that you’d just look at your elaborately constructed false map, and just know that it was a false map without any expected correlation to the territory, and therefore, despite all its elaborate construction, you wouldn’t be able to invest any credulity in it—
</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that reflective consistency will take over and make you stop believing on the object level, once you come to the meta-level realization that the map is not reflecting—
</p>
<p>Then when push comes to shove—you may, indeed, fail.
</p>
<p>When it comes to deliberate self-deception, you must <em>believe in your own inability!</em>
</p>
<p>Tell yourself the effort is doomed—<em>and it will be!</em>
</p>
<p>Is that the power of positive thinking, or the power of negative thinking? Either way, it seems like a wise precaution.
